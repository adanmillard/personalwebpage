          My last role was Warehouse Management, where I learnt a lot about
          leadership, people management, bulk storage management, setting and
          achieving KPI's for myself and my team, critical and logical thinking,
          all in a fast paced environment.

          In the lockdown of 2021 I decided I wanted to do a career pivot and
          make my way into the tech industry, so I joined up with Mission Ready
          HQ to study software development and haven't looked back.

          I have now retrained and am looking to land my first role in tech,
          super exciting times ahead.
